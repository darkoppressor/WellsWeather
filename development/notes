Purpose: Using the NWS JSON web interface, display data for current and forecasted weather
This API seems to be lacking in any sort of documentation, but I did find the XML API documentation which seems similar:
http://graphical.weather.gov/xml/mdl/XML/Design/MDL_XML_Design.pdf
To get data, use this URL format for an HTTP request:
http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=36.272815991465905&lon=-95.85213510465059&FcstType=json
For calculating the heat index, I used the equations found here:
http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/html/heatindex_equation.shtml

App:

Data structures to represent all weather data
Data is stored in memory with the activity
Data is also stored in internal storage

Ideas:
The detailed forecast text does not respect the units option
Is chance of precipitation going to be used for anything?
Notifications
Widget
Format latitude and longitude like on the NWS website
Don't always display heat index just because there is no wind chill
Add sunrise/sunset times
Add phase of the moon
Separate screen for displaying local conditions detected by device sensors
Ability to detect other nearby devices running the app (if both have a sharing setting enabled)
Nearby devices would share their sensor data, which could then be analyzed to avoid incorrect data

App info display should properly handle the case where data is not present
This could occur because no data is present, because no update has ever been done
This could also occur because a certain element was not included in the last update

Update when update button is pressed
Text saying when last update was
There is also text saying the update time for the actual data. I.e., when the source last updated

Update should probably create a background thread that sends the activity the update data
Upon receiving this data, the activity actually updates its information

If a weather period's image uses the new DualImage.php,
create a new bitmap that combines two images just like this
URL format is: 'http://forecast.weather.gov/DualImage.php?i=bkn&j=tsra&jp=20',
where i == left image base name, j == right image base name, ip == left image precipitation chance,
jp == right image precipitation chance

Option for manual location (default: off)
If on, specifies a location to use for updates
Location is specified as a ZIP code or address
Location is then converted to lat/long via the Google geocoding API
If off, needs location permission to use the device's location for updates
Looks like location needs to be in lat/long format

Option for displaying data in SI units or other units (default: other)
The effects of this option are as follows:
Pressure: hectopascals vs millibars
Temperature: degrees C vs degrees F
Distance: feet/miles vs meters/kilometers

Widget (if I add one):

Data is shared between app and widget

Option for automatic update interval (default: 1 hour)
Update every interval
Minimum interval should be 1 hour
This can also be off, meaning never update automatically
